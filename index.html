          >    v is a superheroine appearing in American comic books
                published by Marvel Comics. Created by Steve Englehart and Sal
                  Buscema, the character first appeared in Defenders #4 (November
                    1972).[1][2] She is based on the Norse mythological figure
                    Brynhildr.[3] Valkyrie became a mainstay of the superhero team known  
                      as the Defenders and a close ally and one-time love interest of the
                      god Thor. Valkyrie, also known by her Asgardian name Brunnhilde, was
                      selected by Odin to lead his personal unit of shield-maidens, the
                      Valkyrior. Renowned for her prowess in battle, Valkyrie is often
                        accompanied by her winged horse Aragorn and carries the enchanted
                         sword Dragonfang. In the 2010s, Valkyrie became a founding member of
                        the Secret Avengers and co-leader of the Fearless Defenders with Misty
                        Knight. Among Valkyrie's other aliases are Barbara Norris, Samantha
                       Parrington, Sian Bowen and Annabelle Riggs, who all, at one point,
                     hosted her spirit. Samantha Parrington, one of Valkyrie's previous
                  hosts, later received superhuman powers and became a member of the
                  Defenders herself. Tessa Thompson portrays the character in the Marvel
                 Cinematic Universe films Thor: Ragnarok (2017), Avengers: Endgame
                (2019), Thor: Love and Thunder (2022), and The Marvels (2023).</i
